Keras Models

The resnet50_cifar10 keras model has been adapted from keras/examples/cifar10_resnet.py. The train
function uses the cifar10 dataset and keras's function to load and extract data.

This is an initial version of what a Keras model would look like in the garden. This has also
helped flush out a few details regarding how to use data tensors to train and evaluate models.
